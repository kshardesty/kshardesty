# About Me

Hi there! <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42378118/110234147-e3259600-7f4e-11eb-95be-0c4047144dea.gif' width='25'>

I'm Kathleen. I'm a teacher, scholar, and technical communicator. I have taught a lot of different university courses in English and communication. I also have more
than 20 years of technical writing, editing, and publication design experience, with a focus on the architecture/engineering/construction industry.

My research interests include:

* Visual rhetoric/visual literacy :camera:
* Data visualization :bar_chart:
* Children’s rhetorical agency :girl:
* Sports communication :soccer:
* Art and creativity in technical communication :art:

I have published articles in *Technical Communication* and *IEEE ProComm*. My first book was [published by Routledge earlier this year.](https://www.routledge.com/Violence-Silence-and-Rhetorical-Cultures-of-Champion-Building-in-Sports/Hardesty/p/book/9781032382739) 

I have a PhD in Technical Communication and Rhetoric from Texas Tech University. However, I'm currently exploring R and other data visualization tools under a data science framework.
